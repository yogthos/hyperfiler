/**
 * This function converts all of the images in the image cache, as well as all

 * formats have the widest browser support. The algorithm used to determine the
 * conversion target is as follows:
 *
 * No Alpha Channel TIFF/WEBP   -> JPEG
 * TIFF/WEBP with Alpha Channel -> PNG
 * Animated WEBP                -> GIF
 * SVG                          -> PNG
 *
 * The image formats with the widest browser support are generally JPEG and
 * GIF, with PNG also having very wide support. TIFF images are converted as
 * they do not have supports in Firefox since they are not in a streamable
 * format. WEBP are converted as the format is newer and isn't supported in
 * older browser. Finally, SVG and inline SVG support is limited in older
 * browsers.
